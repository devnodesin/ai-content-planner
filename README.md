# Content Planner


An interactive Python command-line application for AI-powered content idea generation for e-commerce products.
Uses Ollama Cloud to generate smart customer questions and unique content ideas in JSON format.

**The AI acts as a curious customer**, asking genuine questions without assumptions, helping you understand what information your customers need.

Built with Python 3.13 and managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reliable dependency management.

## How It Works


The AI acts as a smart customer evaluating your product, asking genuine questions that real customers would ask before making a purchase. It uses previous Q&A context to ask follow-up questions for unclear areas and explores new product aspects. Content ideas are unique, deduplicated, and returned in JSON format.

**See [SPEC.md](./spec/SPEC.md) for detailed workflow, question logic, and output format.**

## Troubleshooting

### API Not Working?

If you see API errors:

1. Check your `.env` file has valid `OLLAMA_API_KEY`
2. Get/verify API key at [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/)
3. Check internet connection

The application will show a help menu and allow you to continue even if the API is unavailable.
